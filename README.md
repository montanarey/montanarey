### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Montana, and I'm based on Vancouver Island, BC Canada. I'm studying web and app development and design, and have a background in graphic design, marketing, and business. I'm still trying to narrow down my passion, but what I know for sure is that I love to code, I love creating aesthetically pleasing projects, and I really want to challenge myself.

Here's a few things about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on expanding my development and design abilities and know-how.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build iOS apps using Swift.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any design or development projects that will give me experience!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Find me on LinkedIn, Facebook, Intagram, or email me at montana.pistell@hotmail.com
- âš¡ Fun facts: In my spare time I sing semi-professionally, paint landscapes, play video games, and watch anime! My favourite games right now are Genshin Impact and Destiny 2, and my favourite anime (right now) is Neon Genesis Evangelion.
